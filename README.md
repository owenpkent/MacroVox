# MacroVox

**Speak. It types. Anywhere.**

Real-time voice dictation that drops clean, AI-polished text straight into the app you're already using. Built for anyone who finds typing slow, painful, or impractical. Your voice never has to touch a keyboard.

## Install

### Windows

Grab the latest signed installer from the releases repo:

**[Download MacroVox for Windows](https://github.com/okstudio1/macrovox-releases/releases/latest)**

Run `MacroVox_<version>_x64-setup.exe`. It's EV-signed by OK Studio Inc., so there's no SmartScreen warning. The app updates itself: every launch it checks for a newer signed build and installs it in the background. The `.msi` is there for managed or enterprise deployment.

### Linux (beta)

Download the `.deb`, `.rpm`, or AppImage from the [same releases page](https://github.com/okstudio1/macrovox-releases/releases/latest) and install the one that matches your distro. See [Linux notes](#linux-notes) for runtime dependencies and Wayland caveats.

> Binaries live in a separate repo, [`okstudio1/macrovox-releases`](https://github.com/okstudio1/macrovox-releases). Source, issues, and development live here.

### First run

1. Launch MacroVox. A small always-on-top window appears.
2. Sign in and start a trial, **or** paste your own keys under [Settings -> Keys](#bring-your-own-keys).
3. Press the mic (or hit `Ctrl+Space` from any app), talk, and stop. Your words land on the clipboard and, if you enable it, paste straight into the app you were in.

## Why MacroVox

Typing is a barrier for a lot of people. Repetitive strain, limited mobility, fatigue, or just the friction of a keyboard between a thought and the screen. MacroVox closes that gap: speak naturally, and get back text that reads like you meant it to, in whatever app you're working in. Accessibility isn't a feature here, it's the whole point.

## How it works

Audio is captured natively in Rust (no browser mic prompts, low latency), streamed to [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com) Nova-3 for transcription, then handed to [Claude](https://anthropic.com) Haiku to fix speech-to-text slips, punctuation, and formatting. The cleaned text replaces the raw text on your clipboard a moment later, so you never wait on the AI pass.

---

## Features

- **Real-time dictation.** Deepgram Nova-3 in streaming mode (words as you speak) or batch mode (higher accuracy after you stop).
- **AI cleanup.** Claude Haiku polishes every transcript in the background: punctuation, capitalization, and obvious mis-hearings, without changing your meaning.
- **Drop it anywhere.** Auto-copy and auto-paste put text on the clipboard and into the app you were using, the instant you stop. Native key injection via `enigo`.
- **Global hotkey.** Toggle dictation from any app with a shortcut you choose (default `Ctrl+Space`).
- **20 languages.** English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and more. The cleanup prompt is language-aware.
- **Smart number formatting.** Always digits, always words, or a context-aware Smart mode (digits for currency, dates, and measurements; words for small standalone numbers).
- **Keyword boosting.** Teach it your jargon, names, and acronyms so they transcribe correctly.
- **Dictation history.** A rolling buffer saves recordings as OGG Opus (about 10x smaller than WAV) for playback, copying, and one-click reprocessing.
- **Bring your own keys.** Run the whole thing on your own Deepgram and Anthropic accounts, no subscription. [Details below](#bring-your-own-keys).
- **Six themes.** MCRN, Mars, Belter, Earth, Protomolecule, and Laconia.
- **Stays out of the way.** Lives in the system tray, always-on-top dictation window, drag it wherever you like.
- **Signed and self-updating.** EV-signed Windows installer plus an in-app auto-updater.

## Bring your own keys

MacroVox runs as a managed service by default: sign in, start a trial, and the keys are handled for you. Prefer to use your own provider accounts and skip the subscription? Open **Settings -> Keys** and paste them in.

| Key | Powers | Required? | Get one at |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Deepgram** | Speech-to-text | Yes, to record on your own key | [console.deepgram.com](https://console.deepgram.com) |
| **Anthropic** | AI cleanup of transcripts | Optional (raw transcripts still copy without it) | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |

- Keys are stored in the app's local storage on your device. They go only to Deepgram and Anthropic, never to OK Studio's servers.
- A saved **Deepgram** key takes priority over managed keys and unlocks recording immediately, with no sign-in.
- A saved **Anthropic** key sends cleanup straight to the Anthropic Messages API instead of the managed proxy.
- Leave a field blank to fall back to the managed plan for that provider.
- Usage on your own keys is billed to you by Deepgram and Anthropic directly.

## Build from source

MacroVox is a [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) app: a Rust backend in `src-tauri/` and a React + Vite renderer in `src/renderer/`.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js** | 20+ LTS | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| **Rust** | stable | [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) |
| **Git** | any | for cloning |

On Linux you also need the WebKitGTK and ALSA development packages (see [Linux notes](#linux-notes)).

### Run it

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/okstudio1/MacroVox.git
cd MacroVox
python run.py
```

`run.py` checks prerequisites, runs `npm install`, and launches `npx tauri dev`. The first run compiles the Rust backend, which takes a few minutes.

For auth to work, create a `.env` in the project root:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_KEY=your-anon-key
```

To develop against your own provider accounts instead, just paste your keys under Settings -> Keys.

### Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `python run.py` | Start the dev environment (recommended) |
| `npx tauri dev` | Start Tauri dev directly |
| `npm run build:renderer` | Build the renderer only (Vite) |
| `npx tauri build` | Production build plus installer |
| `npm test` | Renderer unit tests (Vitest) |
| `npm run test:rust` | Rust unit tests (cargo) |
| `npm run check:versions` | Verify `tauri` and `@tauri-apps/api` major.minor match |

## Architecture

```
+---------------------------------------------------+
|                  Rust / Tauri 2                   |
|  lib.rs       app lifecycle, tray, global hotkey  |
|  commands.rs  audio, Deepgram, clipboard, paste   |
|  audio.rs     cpal WASAPI capture, WAV encoder    |
|  state.rs     shared AppState (audio, settings)   |
+-----------------------+---------------------------+
                        |  invoke() / emit()
+-----------------------v---------------------------+
|               React Renderer (Vite)               |
|  DictationMode   recording UI                     |
|  SettingsPanel   all user preferences             |
|  tauri-ipc.ts    typed IPC bridge                 |
|  auth.ts         Supabase auth + billing          |
+---------------------------------------------------+
```

The renderer never touches the microphone directly. It asks the Rust side to capture, stream, and inject, which keeps latency low and avoids browser permission prompts. See [`src-tauri/ARCHITECTURE.md`](src-tauri/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full backend tour.

## Linux notes

MacroVox builds `.deb`, `.rpm`, and AppImage bundles. Install the one that matches your distro.

**Runtime dependencies** (Debian/Ubuntu names; check your distro for equivalents):

- `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0` for the Tauri WebView
- `libasound2` and `libpulse0` for audio capture (cpal via ALSA/PulseAudio; PipeWire works through its PulseAudio shim)
- `libayatana-appindicator3-1` for tray icon support

**Display server:**

- **X11** is fully supported. Global hotkey, auto-paste, and clipboard all work as on Windows.
- **Wayland** is partial. Global hotkeys depend on the compositor's XDG portal, and auto-paste via `enigo` is unreliable, so it's disabled automatically (copy and paste manually, or run from an X11 session for full parity). MacroVox detects the session type at startup and reflects the limitation in Settings.

**Microphone picker:** on Linux the dropdown hides ALSA's virtual aliases (`hw:`, `plughw:`, `dmix:`, monitor taps, and friends) so you only see real, named devices. Your choice persists across restarts.
